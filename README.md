# The Hidden Costs of AI: Impact on Climate
## Elissa, Dani, Yangjee

**Background**

The IEA mentions that one ChatGPT request uses 2.9 watt-hours of electricity nearly three times the amount of a Google search (0.3 watt-hours). Currently, most global energy production relies heavily on fossil fuels. So, as energy consumption rises, carbon emissions rise as well. This causes concerns as the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) continues to soar, leading to a larger carbon footprint.

**Our Project**

In this project, we will to analyze the current implications of AI on climate change. In particular, we hypothesize that energy consumption rises as global investment in AI grows, resulting in higher carbon emissions and rising temperatures. This disproportionally affects developing countries, which often lack the resources to address or mitigate the environmental consequences. Ultimately, our findings will discuss whether our hypothesis is true.
